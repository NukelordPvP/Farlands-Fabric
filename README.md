Adds the Farlands to 1.18.1 fabric!

![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/7PXUUkn.png)
if you want to move farlands closer to spawn (or further), make a [custom world](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Custom) and change `xz_scale` for each dimension to move farlands in them.
for example you can multiply it by 2 to get farlands 2x closer to spawn or the other way around.

This mod was created by mahan and nukelord420 for use in Blood N Wine 2 Lite Modpack [WIP] So nukelord can add extra autism to the world!
